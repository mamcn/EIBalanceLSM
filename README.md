# E-I balanced Liquid State Machine (LSM) #

A ![Liquid State Machine (LSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_computing) model with E-I balanced neurons [1][]. The neural model showed self-organized criticality (SOC) [2][][3][], and I used it to do simple computing tasks. See **demo.ipynb** for a simple demo.
